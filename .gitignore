Subject: Acceptance of Offer and Request to Resend Offer Letter

Dear [HRâ€™s Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally accept the job offer for the [Job Title] position. I am truly grateful for this opportunity and excited to continue contributing to [Company Name].

Due to a storage issue with my personal Gmail account, I was unable to receive the initial offer letter as it likely bounced back.

Could you please resend the offer letter to my personal email ID ([Your Personal Email])? I need it to attach the necessary documents as part of the joining formalities.

Thank you very much for your support and understanding. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
